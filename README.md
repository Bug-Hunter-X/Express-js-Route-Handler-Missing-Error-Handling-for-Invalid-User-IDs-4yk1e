# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling for invalid input parameters.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without verifying its validity, which can lead to unexpected errors or crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version with added error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs.

## Bug Description

The original code fails to handle cases where the `userId` parameter is not a valid integer. This can lead to a variety of issues, including:

* `NaN` errors if `parseInt` fails to parse a non-numeric string.
* Unhandled exceptions if the ID is not found in the `users` array and the `find` method attempts to access a non-existent property.

## Solution

The solution includes input validation to ensure the `userId` is a valid integer before attempting to access the `users` array.  It also handles the case where the user is not found with an appropriate HTTP status code.
